# Documentation Mastery

This repository serves as home to a month-long personal experiment to dominate the art of documentation and implement a documentation system. It stores the history and the relative files to the document presented. This is the design and layers of said documentation system. Read the document [here](https://github.com/mariolfh/documentation-mastery/blob/80bd9db1c29f24ca9b52ff6f72ec4fa0dcec4a94/document-mastery.pdf).

This repository was created for history and demonstration purposes. No further updates or substantial changes are planned for this repository, which is meant to be archived. Thank you for reading. _Striving for higher grounds._
