# Documentation Mastery

This repository serves as home to a month-long personal experiment to dominate the art of documentation and implement a documentation system. It stores the history and the relative files to the document presented. This is the design and layers of said documentation system. Read the document [here](https://github.com/mariolfh/documentation-mastery/blob/c65cc540fcfc311f1f2279be70b9b3ef11456e6d/document-mastery.pdf).

This repository was created for history and demonstration purposes. No further updates or substantial changes are planned for this repository, which is meant to be archived. Thank you for reading. _Striving for higher grounds._
